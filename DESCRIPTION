Description: Alluvial diagrams encompass a variety of charts that use x-splines
    (alluvia and flows), sometimes augmented with stacked bars (lodes or
    strata), to visualize incidence structures derived from several data types,
    including categorical repeated measures data and multi-dimensional frequency
    data. This package contains stat and geom layers that interpret multiple
    data formats compatible with this framework while hewing to the principles
    of tidy data and the grammar of graphics.
